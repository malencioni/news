Built a weather and news page. Played with a couple of cool features in Ruby that allow the site to:

-Convert the UNIX time to calendar days and display the correct day of the week
-Convert UTC to CDT
-Grab the correct weather icon based on the forecast for that day
-Change icons for night/day
-Change the background image for weather cards based on today's forecast
-Display the image for the top 5 news stories, and have a backup image if the image URL doesn't exist
